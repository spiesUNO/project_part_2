# Introduction

Signal processing has become an indispensable tool in the world of audio analysis and manipulation. By extracting and manipulating various features of audio signals, it is possible to enhance sound quality, identify specific components, and even create new audio experiences. In this paper, we explore the application of signal processing techniques on the song "The Distance" by Cake, with a focus on the first 30 seconds of the track.

"The Distance" is a highly recognizable and popular alternative rock song that exemplifies Cake's unique musical style. By subjecting this composition to signal processing techniques, we aim to uncover hidden details, enhance audio clarity, and provide a fresh perspective on the song's acoustic properties.

Our approach involves a series of steps, starting with the application of the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to transform the time-domain representation of the audio signal into the frequency domain. This transformation enables us to analyze the distribution of frequencies and identify any underlying patterns that may influence the overall sound. By focusing on the first 30 seconds of the song, we can extract and analyze a specific segment that captures the essence of the composition.

To further refine the audio quality and mitigate potential artifacts introduced during the frequency domain analysis, we apply a raised cosine filter. This filter serves to suppress undesired components and emphasize the important frequencies, leading to a cleaner and more focused sound output. The raised cosine filter is selected for its ability to effectively balance between attenuating unwanted frequencies and preserving the desired ones.

After applying the raised cosine filter, we perform the inverse Fourier Transform to convert the filtered frequency-domain signal back to the time domain. This step reconstructs the processed audio, preserving the key characteristics while incorporating the improvements obtained through the frequency domain manipulation.

Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our signal processing approach by playing the processed audio and comparing it to the original version of "The Distance." By conducting a comprehensive subjective and objective analysis, we aim to demonstrate the enhanced audio experience resulting from our signal processing techniques.

Overall, this paper showcases a novel application of signal processing on the song "The Distance" by Cake. By employing the Fourier Transform, raised cosine filtering, and inverse Fourier Transform, we aim to unlock hidden details and improve the audio quality of the first 30 seconds of the composition. Through our analysis, we seek to provide a fresh perspective on the song's acoustic properties and offer a valuable contribution to the field of audio signal processing.

In addition to its cultural significance, "The Distance" by Cake holds relevance to scientific research within the field of audio analysis. The selection of this particular song for our signal processing study is not arbitrary; it represents an opportunity to explore the potential of applying advanced techniques to a well-known and widely appreciated musical composition.

Scientific research often benefits from real-world examples that resonate with a broad audience. By utilizing a popular song like "The Distance," we can engage both scientific and non-scientific communities in the exploration of signal processing methodologies. This approach allows us to bridge the gap between scientific analysis and the general public's familiarity with the chosen musical piece, fostering greater interest and understanding.

Furthermore, "The Distance" exhibits various sonic elements that make it an intriguing candidate for signal processing analysis. Its composition encompasses a blend of vocals, instrumental tracks, and complex arrangements that challenge conventional audio processing techniques. By focusing on this song, we can address the unique characteristics and challenges present in its audio representation, ultimately contributing to the development of more robust and adaptable signal processing methodologies.

Moreover, the application of signal processing techniques to popular music opens avenues for interdisciplinary collaborations. Researchers from fields such as musicology, psychology, and computer science can converge to explore how signal processing can influence the subjective experience of music. This multidisciplinary approach not only expands the possibilities within audio analysis but also encourages cross-pollination of ideas and methodologies, leading to novel discoveries and advancements in scientific research.

By acknowledging the importance of "The Distance" in scientific research, we recognize the potential impact of our signal processing study. Through this exploration, we aim to inspire further investigations into the application of advanced audio analysis techniques on well-known musical compositions. Ultimately, our findings may contribute to the development of innovative approaches in signal processing and shape the future of audio analysis in diverse scientific disciplines.
