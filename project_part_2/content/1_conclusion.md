# Conclusion

As can be seen and heard from the three versions of the audio files the regular raised cosine does not alter the song by very much. The modified raised cosine however does modify the song quite a bit. It sounds much more muffled as all the high frequency information has been discarded and all but the DC value have been reduced by the raised cosine filter. Similar results could be assumed if the filter was a Gaussian filter depending on the value of sigma.

Overall this was a really fun project and class in general. I truly feel like I have grown and learned a ton this semester. I have a much better understanding of how to write code and good programming practices as well as a better intuitive understanding of many of the physics concepts that we dealt with in this class.
